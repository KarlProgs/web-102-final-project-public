Hello! This is the public release of my final project for [CodePath](https://www.codepath.org/)'s intermediate web development course.
It is a forum that centers around a community. And in my project, it centers around a game called Helldivers.

For the sake of readability, I have edited the README. And for the sake of not exposing my API keys those have been removed from the src/client.jsx file.
You can still use the website in its functional state on [Netlify](https://superlative-flan-ff087e.netlify.app/) (*note: there are some bugs with redirection that are not present in the local version*).
